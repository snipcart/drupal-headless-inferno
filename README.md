![drupal headless](https://snipcart.com/media/204099/drupal-headless.png)

Developers can finally focus on using CMSs solely for what they are good atâ€”content management & administrative process. Other (much better) services can handle the rest!

Here I'm trying this, going headless with Drupal.

I'll use Drupal as a backend for a small e-commerce app powered by the React-like framework Inferno.js. 

Steps:

- Setting up Drupal
- Enabling Drupal headless mode
- Creating views for our products
- Consuming data in Inferno.js
- Generating the cart with Snipcart
